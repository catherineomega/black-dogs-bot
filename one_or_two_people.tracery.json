  "origin": [
    "#one_or_two_people# went to the store."

  "one_or_two_people": [
    "#name1#", "#name2#", "#name1# and #name2#"

  "name1": [
    "Catherine",
    "Michael"
  ],

  "name2": [
    "Hannah",
    "Rebecca"
  ]
}


This will cause Tracery to output one of the following options:
"Catherine went to the store."
"Michael went to the store."
"Hannah went to the store."
"Rebecca went to the store."
"Catherine and Hannah went to the store."
"Catherine and Rebecca went to the store."
"Michael and Hannah went to the store."
"Michael and Rebecca went to the store."




Roughly 66.6% of the time, it will output a single name.
Roughly 33.3% of the time, it will output a pair of names, one from each of "name1" and "name2".



This means:
It will never say "Catherine and Michael" together.
It will never say "Hannah and Rebecca" together.
It will never put "Hannah" or "Rebecca" first.

It will always say these people "went to the store", because we only wrote that part once.
